# ossia-sclang
minimal OSSIA API for supercollider

This project is a fork of [Pierre Cohard's](https://github.com/pchdev) [ossia-supercollider](https://github.com/OSSIA/ossia-supercollider.git)
Form his sclang files, the aim is to provide the same message structure
specific to the [OSSIA](https://github.com/OSSIA/libossia.git) library
and the interactive sequencer [OSSIA/score](https://github.com/OSSIA/score.git)
